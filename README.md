# Vision AI - Real-time Webcam Application

Vision AI is an innovative real-time webcam application that leverages the power of Google's generative AI (Gemini API) to provide dynamic descriptions and responses based on live video feed. This project showcases an advanced integration of computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition to create a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Features

- **Real-time Webcam Feed:** Captures and displays live video from the default webcam.
- **AI-Powered Descriptions:** Utilizes Google's Gemini API to generate descriptive text based on the current webcam feed.
- **Interactive Q&A:** Users can type or speak questions, and the AI provides relevant responses based on the video context.
- **Speech Recognition:** Converts spoken questions to text for AI processing.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Reads out the AI-generated responses for a more engaging experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Modern and intuitive UI built with PyQt5.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language for this project.
- **PyQt5:** Used for building the graphical user interface.
- **OpenCV:** Handles real-time video capture and processing.
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini API):** Provides AI-powered content generation.
- **Pillow:** Processes images captured from the webcam.
- **SpeechRecognition:** Converts spoken language into text.
- **pyttsx3:** Text-to-speech conversion for audible AI responses.
- **qasync:** Integrates asyncio with PyQt5 for asynchronous operations.
